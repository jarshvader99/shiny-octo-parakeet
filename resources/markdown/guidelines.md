# Community Guidelines

**Congressional Consensus** is a civic platform dedicated to informed public discourse and consensus measurement on U.S. Congressional legislation. These guidelines establish the standards for participation in our democratic community.

---

## Our Civic Mission

This platform exists to strengthen American democracy by enabling citizens to engage thoughtfully with legislation affecting their lives. We believe that reasoned discourse, mutual respect, and good-faith engagement are essential to the health of our republic.

**We are not a social media platform.** We are a civic space where citizens come to think, learn, and contribute to the democratic process.

## Principles of Engagement

### 1. Respect the Dignity of All Persons

Every participant in our democracy deserves to be treated with basic human dignity, regardless of political affiliation, background, or viewpoint.

- **Address ideas, not individuals.** Critique arguments and policies, not the people who hold them.
- **Assume good faith.** Most people engage in political discourse because they genuinely care about their community and country.
- **Listen to understand.** Before responding, ensure you understand the position you're addressing.

### 2. Engage with Substance

This platform measures *informed* consensus. Your contributions should reflect genuine engagement with the legislation being discussed.

- **Read before you react.** Review bill summaries and relevant context before forming or expressing opinions.
- **Support your positions.** When stating a stance, explain your reasoning. "I oppose this because..." is more valuable than "This is bad."
- **Acknowledge complexity.** Most legislation involves trade-offs. Recognizing nuance strengthens discourse.

### 3. Honor Democratic Traditions

The American republic was founded on principles of deliberation, compromise, and respect for the rule of law.

- **Respect the process.** Disagreement with outcomes does not justify undermining democratic institutions.
- **Engage peacefully.** All discourse must remain within the bounds of lawful, peaceful expression.
- **Value pluralism.** A healthy democracy includes diverse viewpoints. Disagreement is not disloyalty.

## Moderation Approach

### Transparency

We believe in transparent moderation. When content is removed:
- The author will be notified with a specific reason
- Removal decisions can be appealed
- We publish aggregate moderation statistics quarterly

### Proportionality

Our responses are proportional to the severity and frequency of violations:

1. **First violation (minor):** Content removed with educational notice
2. **Repeated violations:** Temporary posting restrictions
3. **Severe violations:** Immediate account suspension
4. **Egregious violations:** Permanent ban and, where appropriate, referral to authorities

### Context Matters

We consider context when moderating:
- Quoting problematic content to critique it differs from endorsing it
- Academic or historical discussion may reference difficult topics
- Satire and rhetorical questions are evaluated in context

---

## Reporting Violations

If you encounter content that violates these guidelines:

1. Use the **Flag** button on the comment or stance
2. Select the category of violation
3. Add context if helpful (optional)
4. Our moderation team will review within 24 hours

**Do not engage with violating content.** Responding to hateful or inciting content often amplifies it.

---

## Your Responsibilities

By participating in Congressional Consensus, you agree to:

- **Represent yourself honestly.** Use your real identity or a consistent pseudonym; do not impersonate others.
- **Engage in good faith.** Participate to understand and be understood, not merely to "win."
- **Accept responsibility.** Your stances and comments represent your views. Own them.
- **Report violations.** Help maintain community standards by flagging inappropriate content.
- **Respect privacy.** Do not share private communications or personal information of others.

## A Note on Political Viewpoints

**We do not moderate based on political ideology.**

Conservative, liberal, progressive, libertarian, and all other lawful political viewpoints are welcome. You may encounter opinions you strongly disagree with—this is a feature of democracy, not a bug.

What we *do* moderate:
- **How** ideas are expressed (with respect, or with hate)
- **Whether** claims are factually grounded (regarding bill text and legislative process)
- **If** content threatens the safety of others

We will never remove content simply because it represents an unpopular or minority viewpoint.
